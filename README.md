By using these codes analyze, and run the console/terminal/command line application and complete or answer the following challenges or questions.

1. **What is a variable?** A variable is a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C# has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory the range of values that can be stored within that memory and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.

2. Find an example of variable declaration.
3. Find an example of variable initialization.
4. Find an example of variable assignment.

5. **What is a method?** A method is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C# program has at least one class with a method named Main. 
 To use a method, you need to: _Define the method_ and ****_Call the method_****
 The syntax for defining a method in C# is as follows: 
 
_    <Access Specifier> <Return Type> <Method Name>(Parameter List)
    {
   Method Body
    }_
 
  **Access Specifier** − This determines the visibility of a variable or a method from another class.
 
  **Return type** − A method may return a value. The return type is the data type of the value the method returns. If the method is not returning any values, then the     return type is **void**.
 
  **Method name** − Method name is a unique identifier and it is case sensitive. It cannot be same as any other identifier declared in the class.
 
  **Parameter list** − Enclosed between parentheses, the parameters are used to pass and receive data from a method. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and     number of the parameters of a method. Parameters are optional; that is, a method may contain no parameters.
 
 **Method body** − This contains the set of instructions needed to complete the required activity.

6. Find an example of a method signature.
7. Find an example of a method parameter.
8. Find an example of a method return type.

9. **What is a class?**

10. Find an example of a class.
11. Find an example of instantiation.

12. **What is an instance member?**

13. Find an example of an instance variable.
14. Find an example of an instance method.

15. **What is a static member?**

16. Find an example of a static variable.
17. Find an example of a static method.

18. **What is object composition?**

19. Find an example of object composition.

20. **What is overloading/subtype polymorphism?**
The word polymorphism means having many forms. In object-oriented programming paradigm, polymorphism is often expressed as '**_one interface, multiple functions_**'. 
Polymorphism can be _**static _or_ dynamic**_. In static polymorphism, the response to a function is determined at the compile time. In dynamic polymorphism, it is decided at run-time.

21. Find an example of interface implementation.
22. Find an example of a super class.
23. Find an example of a subclass.
24. Find an example of inheritance.
25. Find an example of method overloading.
26. Find an example of a polymorphic call to an overloaded method.

27. **What is type casting?**

28. Find an example of upcasting.
29. Find an example of downcasting.

30. **What is an access modifier?**

31. Find an example of an access modifier.

32. **What is the difference between the access modifiers public, private,
and protected?**

33. **What are some other forms of polymorphism?**

34. Find an example of method overriding.
35. Find an example of parametric polymorphism (generics).

36. **What is modularity?**

37. **What does the application do?**

38. **What does the application print?**

39. **What are some other programs that we could build by composing the
classes of this program in different ways**
