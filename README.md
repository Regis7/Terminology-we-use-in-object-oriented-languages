By using these codes analyze, and run the console/terminal/command line application and complete or answer the following challenges or questions.

1. **What is a variable?**
2. Find an example of variable declaration.
3. Find an example of variable initialization.
4. Find an example of variable assignment.

5. **What is a method?**

6. Find an example of a method signature.
7. Find an example of a method parameter.
8. Find an example of a method return type.

9. **What is a class?**

10. Find an example of a class.
11. Find an example of instantiation.

12. **What is an instance member?**

13. Find an example of an instance variable.
14. Find an example of an instance method.

15. **What is a static member?**

16. Find an example of a static variable.
17. Find an example of a static method.

18. **What is object composition?**

19. Find an example of object composition.

20. **What is overloading/subtype polymorphism?**
The word polymorphism means having many forms. In object-oriented programming paradigm, polymorphism is often expressed as '**_one interface, multiple functions_**'. 
Polymorphism can be _**static _or_ dynamic**_. In static polymorphism, the response to a function is determined at the compile time. In dynamic polymorphism, it is decided at run-time.

21. Find an example of interface implementation.
22. Find an example of a super class.
23. Find an example of a subclass.
24. Find an example of inheritance.
25. Find an example of method overloading.
26. Find an example of a polymorphic call to an overloaded method.

27. **What is type casting?**

28. Find an example of upcasting.
29. Find an example of downcasting.

30. **What is an access modifier?**

31. Find an example of an access modifier.

32. **What is the difference between the access modifiers public, private,
and protected?**

33. **What are some other forms of polymorphism?**

34. Find an example of method overriding.
35. Find an example of parametric polymorphism (generics).

36. **What is modularity?**

37. **What does the application do?**

38. **What does the application print?**

39. **What are some other programs that we could build by composing the
classes of this program in different ways**
